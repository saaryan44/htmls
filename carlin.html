They have no choice. They have owners. They own them. They own all the important lands. They own and control the corporations. </li><li>Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. </li><li>The news and media are not independent. They are a bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class. If the parent corporation doesn't want the public to know something, it won't be on the news. </li><li>Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. </li><li>Never believe anything the governments say.</li><li>People have no idea of what they are doing and a lot of them are really good at it.</li><li>Don't just learn to read. Learn to question what you are reading. Learn to question everything.</li><li>Governments are in the game of controlling thoughts. For that, they have to control language and then information. So, it tells public things they cannot say, by declaring them against the law, or citing it being against a regulation.</li><li>I have never met a man I'd rather be.</li><li>Love yourself first. That is the point of it. That is the point of love. Me first.</li><li>I didn't have any friends at school, didn't want any. I felt better being alone. I sat on a bench and watched the others play and they looked foolish to me.</li><li>The area dividing the brain and the soul is affected in many ways by experience. Some lose all mind and become soul : insane. Some lose all soul and become mind : intellectual. Some lose both and become accepted.</li></ul></body></html>
